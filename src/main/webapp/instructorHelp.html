				<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b><a name="faq1">How do I view a list of students
								in a course?</a></b><br>Go to the ‘Courses’ page, click ‘View’ for
						the relevant course.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq2">How do I change student details
								after enrolling?</a></b><br>Choose to ‘Edit’ a student from the
						student list (see ‘How do I view a list of students in a course?’
						given above).<br> <br>Note: Moving a student to a
						different team (i.e. changing a students team id) will affect all
						existing evaluations in that course. <br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq3">How do I add more students to a
								course?</a></b><br>You can use the ‘Enrol’ feature to add more
						students. If a student you are adding has the same email address
						as an existing student in the class, they will be considered the
						same student and the name, team name and the comment will be
						updated to the new values.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq4">How do I delete students from a
								course?</a></b><br>The ‘Delete’ link is available from the student
						list (see ‘How do I view a list of students in a course?’ given
						above).<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq6">How do I change the Google ID
								associated with a student?</a></b><br>You can do that by editing
						student details (see ‘How do I change student details after
						enrolling?’ given above). But note that any data associated with
						the previous Google ID will not be visible to the student when he
						logs in using the new Google ID.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq7">What to do if a student says
								his/her courses have disappeared from the system?</a></b><br>The
						most likely reason for this is that the student has changed the
						primary email address associated with his/her Google ID. Please
						ask the student to email <a
						href="mailto:teammates@comp.nus.edu.sg">teammates@comp.nus.edu.sg</a>
						so that we help him to rectify the problem.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq8">What to do if a student says he
								cannot submit an evaluation due to some technical glitch?</a></b><br>You
						can ask the student to email his peer evaluation to you and then
						you can enter the details into the system using the ‘edit student
						submissions’ feature, as explained in the ‘Getting started’ guide
						above.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq9">How come the actual contribution
								values entered by the student is different from the values shown
								in the results?</a></b><br>This is because the system ‘normalizes’
						those values so that there is no artificial inflation of
						contribution. For example, if a student says everyone contributed
						‘Equal share + 10%’, the system automatically normalize it to
						‘Equal share’ because in reality that is what the student means.<br>‘Normalize’
						here means scale up/down the values so that the (sum of
						contributions) = (<i>n</i> x Equal Share) where <i>n</i> is number
						of students being reviewed.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq10">Can a student influence his
								‘perceived contribution’ value by awarding himself a larger
								contribution?</a></b><br>No. The perceived contribution is
						calculated based on what his teammates perceive as his
						contribution. His own opinion about his own contribution is not
						considered for the calculation.</li>

				<p>Any evaluation system has both positive and negative effects
					on those being evaluated. As teachers, you are probably keen to
					maximize the positive effect of this system on your course while
					minimizing any negative effects. Here are some of the things you
					could do:</p>
				<br> <br>

				<ul>
					<li><span class="bold">Have frequent peer evaluations.<br></span>
						Rather than have only one peer evaluation at the end of the
						course, have several peer evaluations at different points of the
						course. This way, students get frequent peer-feedback about their
						contribution, giving them plenty of chances to correct their
						conduct as necessary.</li>
					<br>
					<li><span class="bold">Ignore early peer evaluations.<br></span>Consider
						not using initial peer evaluations for grading. Let students know
						that in advance. This gives students time to get used to the
						system and be more relaxed in giving early feedback to peers.</li>
					<br>
					<li><span class="bold">Interpret contribution numbers
							with care.<br>
					</span>Keep in mind the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES are
						based on student perceptions and may not reflect the real
						contribution of a student. Therefore, use those numbers primarily
						for identifying cases that need further investigation.<br>
						You may ignore minor variations in the contribution numbers
						reported by TEAMMATES. The difference between [Equal share] and
						[Equal share - 2%] is not significant and can very well be due to
						rounding off within the system. <br> Keep in mind that it is
						human nature for one to downplay the value of contributions from
						others when one’s own contribution is being compared to that of
						others. As a result, it is common for the ‘perceived contribution’
						to be somewhat lower than what the student actually did.</li>
					<br>
					<li><span class="bold">Tolerate unequal contributions.<br></span>This
						may be a good policy to adopt (If students know this policy, they
						will be more honest in reporting contribution values):<br> It
						is OK to do less than an equal share of the the work, as long as
						you are willing to accept a lower grade than your team members. It
						is your right to decide how much time you allocate to this course.
						How you prioritize your work is your own business.</li>
					<br>
					<li><span class="bold">Announce a 'cooling off' period.<br></span>This
						may be a good guidelines to give to students: <br>If you are
						unhappy about the peer-feedback received, please allow at least
						one day to lapse before you fire off a response email. You are
						likely to respond more rationally when you had some time to think
						it over. Also keep in mind that we do take note of how well you
						handle such a situation. You need to act professionally when
						facing conflicting views, opposition, and even deliberate
						sabotage.</li>
