				<ol type="1">
					<li><span class="bold">Create a course</span>
						<br>Go to the ‘Courses’ page and create a course.
						<br>Some of the elements in the user interface (e.g., text boxes) have hover over tips 
						to tell you what the element does.<br>
							<center>
								<img alt="Instructor add course" src="images/instructorHelp/createCourse.png" width="450" height="auto">
							</center>
						<br><span class="bold">Adding more instructors</span>
						<br>More instructors (e.g. tutors) can be added to a course by going to the ‘edit’ link 
						of the course.
						<br>Note that other instructors have the same privileges as you. e.g. they can delete the 
						course. Finer-grain access control is coming soon.<br><br>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">Enrol students</span>
						<br>Enroll students by clicking the ‘Enroll’ link for the relevant course. That link is 
						available in the ‘Courses’ page and the ‘Home’ page. 
						<br>There is no need to inform students about the enrollment yet. There is nothing for 
						them to do at this point.<br><br>
					</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Create a session</span><br>Go to the ‘Sessions’ page and create a 
					session (there are different session types to choose from).<br><br>
						<center><img alt="Create a session" src="images/instructorHelp/createSession.png" width="700" height="auto"></center><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Session type: Standard team peer evaluation session with fixed questions</li>
						<div style="margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 50px;">
							<ul>
								<li>The more popular type. Optimized for measuring contribution among team members 
								and facilitating peer feedback to team members.</li>
								<li>Easiest to set up. Recommended for new users.</li>
								<li>Questions are fixed.</li>
							</ul>

						<li>Session type: Feedback session with customizable questions</li>
						<div style="margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 50px;">
							<ul>
								<li>Allows you to set your own questions</li>
								<li>More versatile, but slightly more work to set up.</li>
								<li>Allows you to set feedback path for each question. i.e. who give feedback to whom.</li>
								<li>Allows you to set visibility of the responses for each question. i.e. who can see 
								which responses.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</ul>
					<br>Refer to the <a href="/instructorHelp.html#sessionTypes">Session Types</a> section for more 
					information about the session types.<br><br>
					</li>
					<li><span class="bold">At the opening time of the session</span>
						<br>When it is time to open the session (based on the ‘opening time’ you specified), 
						TEAMMATES automatically emails students instructions
						for accessing the session. A copy of that email will be sent to you as well.<br><br>
					</li>
					<li><span class="bold">While the session is open</span>
						<br>You can view responses any time after the session is open, even when the session is still 
						ongoing. Just go to the ‘Sessions’ page and click the corresponding ‘View results/responses’ 
						link. <a href="/instructorHelp.html#sessionTypes">Session Types</a> section has 
						more information about the reports available for different session types.<br>
						<br>Students will be sent a reminder 24 hours before the closing time of a session. 
						In addition, you can send further reminders to students any time while a session is open 
						using the ‘remind’ link.<br> <br>
					</li>
					<li><span class="bold">After the session is closed</span>
						<br>You can publish results (i.e. make it visible to students) using the ‘publish’ link in 
						the ‘Sessions’ page.<br>
						<br>For 'standard team peer evaluation' type sessions, you can edit student submissions after 
						the session is closed, up to the point you publish the results. An ‘Edit’ link is available 
						in the summary view, when sorted ‘by reviewer’. This feature is useful for moderating student 
						submissions before publishing, if required.<br><br>Results of sessions can be downloaded in 
						spreadsheet format.<br><br>
					</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Any time</span>
						<br>You can use the ‘Students’ page any time to do these things:
						<br><span class="bold">a. Email a group of students</span>:
							Filter out students in  certain teams/courses and email them. Also handy for locating the email of any past student.
						<br><span class="bold">b. Comment on students</span>:
							Add private comments about any student. Handy for saving and retrieving comments about a student quickly.
						<br><span class="bold">c. View all past records of a student</span>:
							See in one place all submissions given/received by a student. Handy for examining how a student progressed through a course.<br><br>

				<ul>
					<li><b><a name="faq1" id="question">How do I view a list of students
								in a course?</a></b><br>Go to the ‘Courses’ page, click ‘View’ for
						the relevant course.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq2" id="question">How do I change student details
								after enrolling?</a></b><br>Choose to ‘Edit’ a student from the
						student list (see ‘How do I view a list of students in a course?’
						given above).<br> <br>Note: Moving a student to a
						different team (i.e. changing a students team id) will affect all
						existing sessions in that course. <br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq3" id="question">How do I add more students to a
								course?</a></b><br>You can use the ‘Enrol’ feature to add more
						students. If a student you are adding has the same email address
						as an existing student in the class, they will be considered the
						same student and the name, team name and the comment will be
						updated to the new values.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq4" id="question">How do I delete students from a
								course?</a></b><br>The ‘Delete’ link is available from the student
						list (see ‘How do I view a list of students in a course?’ given
						above).<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq6" id="question">How do I change the Google ID
								associated with a student?</a></b><br>You can do that by editing
						student details (see ‘How do I change student details after
						enrolling?’ given above). But note that any data associated with
						the previous Google ID will not be visible to the student when he
						logs in using the new Google ID.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq7" id="question">What to do if a student says
								his/her courses have disappeared from the system?</a></b><br>The
						most likely reason for this is that the student has changed the
						primary email address associated with his/her Google ID. Please
						ask the student to email <a
						href="mailto:teammates@comp.nus.edu.sg">teammates@comp.nus.edu.sg</a>
						so that we help him to rectify the problem.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq7a" id="question">How do I
								interpret/use contribution values in evaluation reports?</a></b><br>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="bold gray">E (Equal share)</span> is a
								relative measure. e.g. For a 3-person team, an ‘Equal
								share’ means ‘a third of the total work done’.</li>
							<li><span class="bold gray">CC (Claimed Contribution)</span>
								: This is what the student claimed he contributed.</li>
							<li><span class="bold gray">Ratings Received </span>: These
								are the peer opinions as to how much the student contributed.
								These values have been adjusted to neutralize any attempts by
								students to boost their own standing by rating others low.</li>
							<li><span class="bold gray">PC (Perceived
									Contribution)</span>: This is the average value of the ‘Ratings
								Received’. This can be considered as the <span class="italic">team’s
									perception of how much the student contributed</span>.</li>
							<li><span class="bold gray">Diff</span> : The difference
								between the claimed contribution (CC) and the perceived
								contribution (PC). This value can be used to identify those who
								have over/under-estimated their own contribution.</li>
						</ul> <br> The above values can be used to identify relative
						contribution levels of students in a team. If you use these values
						for grading, also refer the ‘Interpret contribution numbers with
						care’ caveat in the <a href="#tips" class="toc">Tips for using
							the system</a> section below.<br> <br></li>

					<li><b><a name="faq8" id="question">What to do if a student says he
								cannot submit an evaluation due to some technical glitch?</a></b><br>You
						can ask the student to email his peer evaluation to you and then
						you can enter the details into the system using the ‘edit student
						submissions’ feature, as explained in the ‘Getting started’ guide
						above.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq9" id="question">How come the
								actual contribution values entered by the student is different
								from the values shown in the results?</a></b><br>This is because
						the system ‘normalizes’ those values so that there is no
						artificial inflation of contribution. For example, if a student
						says everyone contributed ‘Equal share + 10%’, the system
						automatically normalize it to ‘Equal share’ because in reality
						that is what the student means.<br>‘Normalize’ here means
						scale up/down the values so that the (sum of contributions) = (<span
						class="italic">n</span> x Equal Share) where <span class="italic">n</span>
						is the number of students being reviewed.<br> <br></li>
					<li><b><a name="faq10" id="question">Can a student influence his
								‘perceived contribution’ value by awarding himself a larger
								contribution?</a></b><br>No. The perceived contribution is
								calculated based on what his team members perceive as his contribution.
								His own opinion about his own contribution is not considered for the calculation.
								<br><br>Students enter contribution estimates for self and team members, using
								the scale Equal share + x%. e.g. Equal share -10%<br><br>Based on those values,
								we try to deduce the student's answer to the following two questions:<br>
								(a) In your opinion, what portion of the project did you do?<br>
								(b) In your opinion, if your teammates are doing the project by themselves without
								you, how do they compare against each other in terms of contribution?<br><br>
								In the calculation, we do not allow (a) to affect (b). We use (b) to calculate the
								average perceived contribution for each student. A more detailed version of this
								calculation can be found here.</li><br>
					<li><b><a name="faq11" id="question">How are the contribution
								numbers calculated?</a></b><br>You can find the details of the
						contribution calculation scheme <a

				<p>Any evaluation system has both positive and negative effects
					on those being evaluated. As teachers, you are probably keen to
					maximize the positive effect of this system on your course while
					minimizing any negative effects. Here are some of the things you
					could do:</p>
				<br> <br>

				<ul>
					<li><span id="question">Have frequent peer evaluations.<br></span>
						Rather than have only one peer evaluation at the end of the
						course, have several peer evaluations at different points of the
						course. This way, students get frequent peer-feedback about their
						contribution, giving them plenty of chances to correct their
						conduct as necessary.<br>
					<br></li>
					<li><span id="question">Ignore early peer evaluations.<br></span>Consider
						not using initial peer evaluations for grading. Let students know
						that in advance. This gives students time to get used to the
						system and be more relaxed in giving early feedback to peers.<br>
					<br></li>
					<li><span id="question">Interpret contribution numbers
							with care.<br>
					</span>Keep in mind the contribution numbers reported by TEAMMATES are
						based on student perceptions and may not reflect the real
						contribution of a student. Therefore, use those numbers primarily
						to identify cases that need further investigation.<br> You
						may ignore minor variations in the contribution numbers reported
						by TEAMMATES. The difference between [Equal share] and [Equal
						share - 2%] is not significant and can very well be due to
						rounding off within the system. <br> Keep in mind that it is
						human nature for one to downplay the value of contributions from
						others when one’s own contribution is being compared to that of
						others. As a result, it is common for the ‘perceived contribution’
						to be somewhat lower than what the student actually did. <br>
						When taking further actions based on evaluation reports, also pay
						attention to the team’s consensus level about the contribution of
						a student. For example, you can take further actions with more
						confidence if all team members rated a certain student’s
						contribution low.<br>
					<br></li>
					<li><span id="question">Tolerate unequal contributions.<br></span>This
						may be a good policy to adopt (If students know this policy, they
						will be more honest in reporting contribution values):<br>
					<br> <span class="italic">It is OK to do less than an
							equal share of the the work, as long as you are willing to accept
							a lower grade than your team members. It is your right to decide
							how much time you allocate to this course. How you prioritize
							your work is your own business.</span><br>
					<br></li>
					<li><span id="question">Announce a 'cooling off'
							period.<br>
					</span>This may be a good guidelines to give to students: <br>
					<br> <span class="italic">If you are unhappy about the
							peer-feedback received, please allow at least one day to lapse
							before you fire off a response email. You are likely to respond
							more rationally when you had some time to think it over. Also
							keep in mind that we do take note of how well you handle such a
							situation. You need to act professionally when facing conflicting
							views, opposition, and even deliberate sabotage.</span><br>

						<span class="bold"><a name="evalType">1. Standard team peer evaluation session with fixed questions</a></span>
						<br><br>Setting up is as easy as submitting this form.<br>
						<br><img alt="Create evaluation session" src="images/instructorHelp/createEvaluation.png" width="780" height="auto"><br>
						<br>If you do not want students to give peer feedback to each other, you can disable the
						‘peer feedback’ option.
						<br>These are the things students will submit:<br>
						<br>(a) A self evaluation:<br>
						<br><img alt="Self evaluation" src="images/instructorHelp/evalToSelf.png" width="630" height="auto"><br>
						<br>(b) A peer evaluation for each team member:<br>
						<br><img alt="Peer evaluation" src="images/instructorHelp/evalToPeer.png" width="630" height="auto"><br>
						<br><br>The “My feedback to this team member” text box is shown only if the ‘peer feedback’
						option is enabled for the session.<br><br>You can see summary reports, like this:
						<br><br><img alt="Evaluation summary report" src="images/instructorHelp/evalSummary.png" width="800" height="auto"><br>
						<br><br>‘Perceived contribution’ column shows, the average contribution level of a student,
						as estimated by team members. In the example above, members of Team 1 seem to be
						contributing equally while there is a slight contribution difference in Team 2.<br>
						<br>Note that our perceived contribution calculation neutralizes any student attempts
						to underreport peer contributions by overestimating own contribution.<br>
						<br>Details reports are also available. A sample extract is given below, which shows the
						result for one student.
						<br><br><img alt="Evaluation result details" src="images/instructorHelp/evalResult.png" width="800" height="auto"><br>
						<br><br>If you publish the results, students receive an email with the link for accessing the
						results. Here is a sample of what a student sees:
						<br><br><img alt="Evaluation result seen by students" src="images/instructorHelp/evalResultToStudent.png" width="800" height="auto"><br>
						<br>Note how the student can easily compare his/her own view of the contribution
						distribution with the team’s view.<br><br><br>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold"><a name="fbType">2. Feedback session with customizable questions</a></span>
						<br>
						<br>This is the form used to set up the session.
						<br><br><img alt="Create feedback session" src="images/instructorHelp/createFeedbackSession.png" width="780" height="auto"><br>
						<br>Note the options for making the session private (for you to record your
						feedback about students) and for publishing the responses automatically at a
						given time.<br>
						<br><br>After setting up the session, we need to add questions. Here is an example
						of setting up a question:
						<br><br><img alt="Add a feedback question" src="images/instructorHelp/addFeedbackQuestion.png" width="650" height="auto"><br>
						<br>Note how we can set the feedback path and visibility level for each question.
						The sample question above is for instructors (i.e. you, tutors, co-lecturers) to
						give feedback to teams in the course. The receiving team can see the feedback and
						identify who gave the feedback. All instructors can see all the feedback as well
						as who gave feedback to whom.<br>
						<br><br>When the session is open, an instructor can
						answer the above question. This is how it will look like:
						<br><br><img alt="Answering feedback question" src="images/instructorHelp/submitFeedbackQuestion.png" width="650" height="auto"><br>
						<br><br>Here is another example question:
						<br><br><img alt="Feedback MCQ question" src="images/instructorHelp/addFeedbackMCQQuestion.png" width="650" height="auto"><br>
						<br>This question is for students to give feedback to their own team members.
						The feedback receiver can see the feedback, but not who gave the feedback. Instructors
						can see who received what feedback, but not who gave the feedback.<br>
						<br>As you can see, these session are very flexible and can cater for a wide variety of 
						feedback scenarios, sometimes within a single session.<br><br>You can see responses in
						several different formats. An example is given below:
						<br><br><img alt="Feedback response" src="images/instructorHelp/feedbackResponse.png" width="700" height="auto"><br>
						<br><br>If you publish results, students receive an email with a link to access responses.
						What they can see is governed by the visibility levels you set when setting up the session.
						Here is an example of what a student sees:<br>
						<br><br><img alt="Feedback result received by student" src="images/instructorHelp/feedbackResult.png" width="630" height="auto"><br>
