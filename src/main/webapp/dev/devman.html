	<h1 id="project">Project</h1>

	<h2 id="project-vision">Vision</h2>

	Long term goal: Become the
	<span class="bold">biggest student project in the world</span>.
	<br> {Biggest = many contributors, many users, relatively large
	code base (50k-100k LoC), evolving over a long period.}
	<br> 'Biggest' above also implies an exceptionally high quality
	standard because high quality is a necessity for the long-term survival
	of a big student project.
	<br>
	<br> This project will also serve as
	<span class="bold"> a model and a training ground for Software
		Engineering students </span> who want to learn SE skills in the
	context of a non-trivial real software product.
	<br>

	<h2 id="project-challenges">Challenges</h2>
	The project differs from typical student projects in the following
	areas, which makes it more challenging and the experience more
	enriching.
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="bold">Developers</span>: All developers are
			novices and their involvement with the project is short term and part
			time.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">Code</span>: Working with legacy code
			written by past developers is harder than writing from scratch.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">Data</span>: The data in the live system
			are confidential and developers are not allowed to see them. This
			makes troubleshooting harder.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">Releases</span>: Frequent releases to an
			active user database requires us to maintain 'production quality'
			constantly.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">Platform</span>: TEAMMATES is running on
			Google App Engine cloud platform, which adds the following
			challenges.
			<ul>
				<li>It is an emerging platform evolving rapidly. We have to
					keep up.</li>
				<li>It imposes various restrictions on the application. e.g.
					Each request to the app has be served within 60 seconds.</li>
				<li>It charges us based on usage. We have to optimize usage.</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li><span class="bold">Software Engineering</span>: As TEAMMATES
			serve as a model system for training students, it should also focus
			on applying good SE techniques.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="project-principles">Principles</h2>
	We apply these principles to meet the challenges stated above.
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="bold">We keep moving forward, always</span>: We
			release frequently, in weekly <a
			href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing">time-boxed
				iterations</a>. Every week, our product becomes better than the previous
			week. This means 'go back and rewrite from scratch' is only a last
			resort.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">We are agile</span>: We are able to change
			the system quickly and easily to match emerging requirements. We
			aim for minimal yet sufficient documentation.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">We defend our code with tests,
				fiercely</span>: Since we practice <a
			href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/collective.html">collective
				code ownership</a>, we have to make sure the code is not accidentally
			broken by others. We use fully automated regression testing. The
			testing automation level of this project is probably higher than 99%
			of the projects out there.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">We are 'Gods' of the few tools we
				use</span>: We stick to a minimal toolset. Adding third-party tools and
			libraries to the project is done only if there is a STRONG
			justification. Only mature, stable, and well-supported tools are
			considered. Once selected, we should know the tool very well to get
			the best out of it.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">We value quality more than
				functionality</span>: Our job is not to 'anyhow get it to work'. The
			system should be good enough to be considered a 'model' software. Our
			code should be of 'unusually' high quality: All code is reviewed before
			accepting.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">We know what we are doing</span>: For us,
			it is not enough to know something is broken, we should also know why
			it is broken. It is not enough to get something working, we should
			know how we got it to work.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">We seek the best, not stop at the
				first</span>: We do not settle for the first workable method to solve a
			problem. We study other ways of solving it and decide what is the
			best way for us.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">We take pains to save the team from
				pain</span>: Whenever we had to spend effort in figuring out something, we
			refine code/documents so that others don't have to go through the
			same pain. Whenever we figured out a less painful way of doing
			something, we make sure everyone in the team learn it too.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="design-architecture">Architecture</h2>

	<div class="image-holder">

	</div>

	<br> TEAMMATES is a Web app that runs on Google App Engine (GAE)
	cloud platform. Given above is an overview of the main components.
	<br>

	<ul>
		<li><span class="bold">UI</span>: The UI seen by users consists
			of Web pages containing HTML, CSS (for styling) and JavaScripts (for
			client-side interactions such as sorting, input validation etc.).
			This UI is generated by Java Server Pages (JSP) and Java Servlets
			residing on the server. Requests are sent to the server over normal
			HTTP. In future, AJAX may be used sparingly to fetch data from the
			server asynchronously.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">Logic</span>: The main logic of the app is
			in Java POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects). Some automated tasks are
			implemented as Servlets.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">Storage</span>: Storage uses the
			persistence framework provided by GAE 'datastore', a noSQL database.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">Test Driver</span>: TEAMMATES makes heavy
			use of automated regression testing. TestNG is used for Java unit
			testing and QUnit for JavaScript unit testing. We use Selenium Web
			Driver to automate UI testing. Test Driver can access the application
			directly to set up test data. We use JSON format to transmit such
			data to the application.</li>
		<li><span class="bold">Client</span>: The Client component can
			connect to the back end directly without using a Browser. It is used
			for administrative purposes. e.g., migrating data to a new schema</li>
		<li><span class="bold">Common</span>: The Common component
			contains utility code used across the application.</li>
	</ul>
	The diagram below shows how the code is organized into packages inside
	each component and dependencies among them.
	<div class="image-holder">
		<img class="image" src="images/packageDiagram.png" width="90%" />
	</div>
	<br> Notes:
	<ul>
		<li>[logic] - [ui::view] - [ui::controller] represent an
			application of Model-View-Controller pattern.</li>
		<li>ui::view and ui::website packages are not Java packages. They
			consist of jsp, html, js and css files.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2 id="design-ui">UI</h2>
	The diagram below shows the object structure of the UI component.
	<div class="image-holder">
		<img class="image" src="images/UiComponent.png" width="90%" />
	</div>
	<br>

	<h3>Request flow</h3>
	Request from the Browser for a specific page will go through following steps:
	<br></br>

	<div class="image-holder">
		<img src="images/UiWorkflow.png" width="100%"></img>
	</div>

	<ol>
		<li>Request received by the GAE server.</li>
		<li>Custom filters are applied according to the order
			specified in <span class="code">web.xml</span>. In our case this
			would be <span class="code">DatastoreFilter</span> and <span
			class="code">LoginFilter</span>. For example, the <span class="code">LoginFilter</span>
			will forward any request from not-logged-in users to the login page.
			If the request is from logged in user, then it will proceed according
			to the URL. e.g. <span class="code">/page/instructorHomePage</span>
		</li>
		<li>Request forwarded to the <span class="code">ControllerServlet</span>.
		</li>
		<li><span class="code">ControllerServlet</span> uses the <span
			class="code">ActionFactory</span> to generate the matching <span
			class="code">Action</span> object. E.g., <span class="code">InstructorHomePageAction</span>.
		</li>
		<li><span class="code">ControllerServlet</span> executes the
			action.</li>
		<li>The <span class="code">Action</span> object checks the access
			rights of the user. If the action is allowed, it interacts with the <span
			class="code">Logic</span> component to perform the action.
		</li>
		<li>Assuming the action was loading a page, the <span
			class="code">Action</span> gathers the data required for the page
			into a <span class="code">PageData</span> object. e.g. <span
			class="code">InstructorHomePageData</span>, creates a <span
			class="code">ShowPageResult</span> object by encolosing the <span
			class="code">PageData</span> object created previously, and returns
			it to the <span class="code">ControllerServlet</span>
		</li>
		<li><span class="code">ControllerServlert</span> "sends" the
			result. In the case of a <span class="code">ShowPageResult</span>,
			this is equivalent to forwarding to the matching JSP page.</li>
		<li>The JSP page uses the data in the given <span class="code">PageData</span>
			object to generate the HTML page.
		</li>
		<li>The response will then be sent back to the Browser, which
			will render the page.</li>
	</ol>

	Things to note:
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>After performing certain actions, the Browser should load
			another page, possibly with the status of the previous action. For
			example, if the action is 'delete course', the Browser should load
			the 'courses' page after the server performed the action. In such
			cases, the result generated for the action will be of type <span
			class="code">RedirectResult</span> which simply instructs the Browser
			to send a fresh request for the specified page. In such cases, we do
			not create a <span class="code">PageData</span> object for the
			original request.<br> Example:
			<ul>
				<li>Browser request for 'delete course' action.</li>
				<li>Server performs the action (creates a <span class="code">RedirectResult</span>
					object but no <span class="code">PageData</span> object) and
					instructs the Browser to load the 'courses' page.
				</li>
				<li>As instructed, the Browser requests for the 'courses' page.
				</li>
				<li>Server processes the request separately (creates a <span
					class="code">ShowPageResult</span> object but and a <span
					class="code">PageData</span> object) and returns the 'courses' page.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The result of some actions is downloading of a file (e.g. an
			evaluation report). In such cases, the result type will be <span
			class="code">FileDownloadResult</span> and no <span class="code">PageData</span>
			object will be generated.
		</li>
		<li>Since the high-level workflow of processing a request is same
			for any request, we use the , the <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern">Template
				Method pattern</a> to abstract the process folow into the <span
			class="code">Action</span> class.
		</li>
		<li>The list of actions and corresponding URIs are listed in the
			<span class="code">ActionURIs</span> nested class of the <a
			href="https://code.google.com/p/teammatespes/source/browse/src/main/java/teammates/common/util/Const.java"
			target="_blank"><span class="code">Const</span></a> class.
		</li>
		<li>The list of pages and corresponding URIs are listed in the
			<span class="code">ViewURIs</span> nested class of the <a
			href="https://code.google.com/p/teammatespes/source/browse/src/main/java/teammates/common/util/Const.java"
			target="_blank"><span class="code">Const</span></a> class.
		</li>
	</ul>



	<h3>Types of pages</h3>
	The UI consist of following pages:
	<ul>
		<li>Product pages (functional): e.g., 'courses' page. These require login.</li>
		<li>Product pages (peripheral): e.g., help pages, error pages. etc.</li>
		<li>Website pages: These are the static pages of the product website. e.g., <span class="code">contact.html</span></li>
		<li>Project pages: Pages meant for developers, such as this page.
	</ul>

	<h2 id="design-logic">Logic</h2>

	The
	<span class="code">Logic</span> component handles the business logic of
	TEAMMATES.
	<br> It is accessible via a thin
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern">facade class</a>
	called
	<a
		href="https://code.google.com/p/teammatespes/source/browse/src/main/java/teammates/logic/api/Logic.java"
		target="_blank"><span class="code">Logic</span></a> which makes use of
	several
	<span class="code">*Logic</span> classes to handle the logic related to
	various types of data and to access data from the
	<span class="code">Storage</span> component. In particular, Logic is
	responsible for these:
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Managing relationships between entities. e.g., cascade logic
			for create/update/delete.</li>
		<li>Managing transactions. e.g., to ensure atomicity of a
			transaction.</li>
		<li>Sanitizing input values recevied from the UI component.</li>
		<li>Providing a mechanims for checking access control rights.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="image-holder">
		<img src="images/LogicComponent.png" width="90%" />
	</div>
	<br>

	Package overiew:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="code bold">logic.api</span>: Provides the normal API of the component.</li>
		<li><span class="code bold">logic.backdoor</span>: Provides a mechanism for the test driver to access data.</li>
		<li><span class="code bold">logic.core</span>: Contains the core logic of the system.</li>
		<li><span class="code bold">logic.automated</span>: Contains the logic of automated tasks.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Logic API</h3>
	Represented by these classes:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="code">Logic</span>: For the use of the UI. <span
			class="code">Logic</span> class acts as a facade between UI
			(servlets) and the backend of the app.</li>
		<li><span class="code">GateKeeper</span>: For the use of the UI. To
			check the access rights of a user for a given action.</li>
		<li><span class="code">BackDoorLogic</span>: For the use of <span
			class="code">TestDriver</span> (via <span class="code">BackDoorServlet</span>)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Policies</h3>
	General:
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Null values should <span class="bold">not</span> be used as
			parameters to this API, except when following the KeepExisting policy
			(explained later).
		</li>
	</ul>

	<br>Access control:
	<ul>
		<li>Although this component provides methods to perform access control,
		it API itself is not access controlled. The UI is expected to check access
		control (using <span class="code">GateKeeper</span> class) before calling a method in the <span class="code">Logic</span>.
		<li>However, calls received by <span class="code">BackDoorServlet</span>
			are authenticated using the 'backdoor key'. Backdoor key is a string
			known only to the person who deployed the app (typically, the
			administrator).
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br>API for creating entities:
	<ul>
		<li>Null parameters: Causes an assertion failure.</li>
		<li>Invalid parameters: Throws <span class="code">InvalidParametersException</span>.</li>
		<li>Entity already exists: Throws <span class="code">EntityAlreadyExists</span>
			exception (escalated from <span class="code">Storage</span> level).
		</li>
		<li>When creating <span class="code">Evaluations</span>, <span
			class="code">Submission</span> entities are automatically created at
			the time of creating an evaluation or changing the team structure of
			a course.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br>API for retrieving entities:
	<ul>
		<li>Attempting to retrieve objects using <span class="code">null</span>
			parameters: Causes an assertion failure.
		</li>
		<li>Entity not found: <br> -Returns <span class="code">null</span>
			if the target entity not found. This way, read operations can be used
			easily for checking the existence of an entity.<br> -Throws <span
			class="code">EntityDoesNotExistsExeption</span> if a parent entity
			of a target entity is not found e.g., trying to list students of a
			non-existent course.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br>API for updating entities:
	<ul>
		<li>Primary keys cannot be edited except: <span class="code">Student.email.</span>
		</li>
		<li>KeepExistingPolicy: the new value of an optional attribute is
			specified as <span class="code">null</span> or set to
			“Uninitialized”, the existing value will prevail. {This is not a good
			policy. To be reconsidered}.
		</li>
		<li><span class="code">Null</span> parameters: Throws an
			assertion error if that parameter cannot be null. Optional attributes
			follow KeepExistingPolicy.</li>
		<li>Entity not found: Throws <span class="code">EntityDoesNotExistException</span>
			exception.
		</li>
		<li>Invalid parameters: Throws <span class="code">InvalidParametersException.</span>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<br>API for deleting entities:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="code">Null</span> parameters: Not expected.
			Results in assertion failure.</li>
		<li>FailDeleteSilentlyPolicy: In general, delete operation do not
			throw exceptions if the target entity does not exist. Instead, it
			logs a warning. This is because if it does not exist, 
			it is as good as deleted.</li>
		<li>Cascade policy: When a parent entity is deleted, entities
			that have referential integrity with the deleted entity should also
			be deleted. <br> Refer to the API for the cascade logic.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="design-storage">Storage</h2>
	The
	<span class="code">Storage</span> component performs CRUD (Create,
	Read, Update, Delete) operations on data entities individually. 
	
	<div class="image-holder">
		<img src="images/StorageComponent.png" width=100% />
	</div>
	
	Package overiew:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="code bold">storage.api</span>: Provides the normal API of the component.</li>
		<li><span class="code bold">storage.entity</span>: Classes that represent persistable entities.</li>
		<li><span class="code bold">storage.datastore</span>: Classes for dealing with the datastore.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<br>Storage contains minimal logic beyond what is directly relevant to
	CRUD operations. <br> In particular, it handles these:
	<ul>
		<li>Validating data inside entities before creating/updating
			them, to ensure they are in a valid state.</li>
		<li>Hiding the complexities of datastore from the <span
			class="code">Logic</span> component. All GQL queries are to be
			contained inside the <span class="code">Storage</span> component.
		</li>
		<li>Protecting persitable objects: Classes in the <span
			class="code">storage::entity</span> package are not visible outside
			this component to prevent accidental modification to the entity's
			attributes (Since these classes have been marked as 'persistence
			capable', and changes to their attributes are automatically persisted
			to the datastore by default). <br> Instead, a corresponding
			non-persistent <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">data
				transfer object</a> named <span class="code">*Attributes</span> (e.g., <span
			class="code">CourseAttributes</span> is the data transfer object for
			<span class="code">Course</span> entities) object is returned, where
			values can be modified easily without any impact on the persistent
			data copy. These datatransfer classes are in <span class="code">common::datatransfer</span>
			package explained later. Note: This decision was taken before GAE
			started supporting <a
			href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/jdo/creatinggettinganddeletingdata">
				the ability to 'detach' entities </a> to prevent accidental
			modifications to persistable data. The decision to use data transfer
			objects is to be reconsidered in the future.
		</li>
	</ul>
	The <span class="code">Storage</span> component will not perform any
	cascade delete/create operations.Cascade logic is currently handled by
	the <span class="code">Logic</span> component.
	<br>  

	
	<br> Note that the navigability of the association links between
	entity objects appear to be in the reverse direction of what we see in
	a normal OOP design. This is because we want to keep the data scheme
	flexible so that new entity types can be added later with minimal
	modifications to existing elements.

	<h3>Policies</h3>
	Add and Delete operations try to wait until data is persisted in the
	datastore before returning. This is not enough to compensate for
	eventual consistency involving multiple servers in the GAE production
	enviornment. However, it is expected to avoid test failures caused by
	eventual consistency in dev server and reduce such problems in the live server.
	<br> Note: 'Eventual consistency' here means it takes some time
	for a database operation to propagate across all serves of the Google's
	distributed datastore. As a result, the data may be in an inconsistent
	states for short periods of time although things should become
	consistent 'eventually'. For example, an object we deleted may appear
	to still exist for a short while.
	<br>
	<br> Implementation of Transaction Control has been decided
	against due to limitations of GAE environment and the nature of our
	data schema. Please see
	<a

		Decision Analysis </a> document for more information.
	<br>
	<br> General:
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>If <span class="code">Null</span> is passed as a parameter,
			the corresponding value is <span class="bold">NOT</span> modified, as
			per the KeepExistingPolicy that was previously mentioned.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br> API for creating:
	<ul>
		<li>Attempt to create an entity that already exists: Throws <span
			class="code">EntityAlreadyExists</span> exception.
		</li>
		<li>Attempt to create an entity with invalid data: Throws <span
			class="code">InvalidParametersException</span></li>
	</ul>
	<br> API for retrieving:
	<ul>
		<li>Attempt to retrieve an entity that does not exist: Returns <span
			class="code">null</span>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br> API for updating:
	<ul>
		<li>Attempt to update an entity that does not exist: Throws <span

		</li>
		<li>Attempt to update an entity with invalid data: Throws <span

	</ul>
	<br> API for deleting:

		<li>Attempt to delete an entity that does not exist: Fails silently.</li>
	</ul>

	They can be combined in various ways to transfer structured data between
	components. Given below are three examples.
	<br>
	<div class="image-holder">
		<img src="images/dataTransferClasses.png" width=90% />
	</div>
	<br> (a)
	<span class="code">Test Driver</span> can use the
	<span class="code">DataBundle</span> in this manner to send an
	arbitrary number of objects to be persisted in the database.
	<br> (b) This structure can be used to transfer data of a course
	 (e.g., when constructing the home page for an
	instructor).
	<br> (c) This structure can be used to send results of an
	evaluation (e.g., when showing an evaluation report to an instructor)
	<br>
	<br> For convenience, these classes use public variables for data.
	This is not a good practice as it contravenes OO principle of
	<i>information hiding</i> and increases the risk of inconsistent data.
	This strategy is to be reconsidered at a later date.
	<br>


	<h2 id="design-testdriver">TestDriver</h2>
	This component automates the testing of TEAMMATES.
	<br>
	<div class="image-holder">
		<img src="images/TestDriverComponent.png" width=100% />
	</div>
	Package overiew:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="code bold">test.driver</span>: Contains

		<li><span class="code bold">test.pageobjects</span>: Contains
			abstractions of the pages as the appear on a Browser (i.e. SUTs).</li>
		<li><span class="code bold">test.cases</span>: Contains test

			</ul></li>
	</ul>
	Notes:
	<ul>
		<li>Component tests: Some of these are pure unit tests (i.e.,

			that tests units as well as integration of units with each other.<br>
		</li>
		<li><span class="code">AllJsTests.java</span> (implemented as a

	</ul>

	<h2 id="settingup-settingupdevserver">Setting up the dev server</h2>
	'Dev server' means running the server in localhost mode.
	<ol>

				# prevent qrefresh
				from updating timestamps<br> nodates=1<br> 
				# force all
				patches to always be in git format<br> 
				git=1<br>
			</span>
		</li>
		<li>Create config files {these are not under revision control
			because their content vary from developer to developer}.
			<ol type="a">
				<li><span class="code"><span class="blue">src/main/resources/</span><span
						class="bold">build.properties</span></span> <br> Use <span
					class="code">build.template.properties</span> as a template (i.e.
					copy → paste → rename)<br> For dev server testing, property
					values can remain as they are.</li>
				<li><span class="code"><span class="blue">src/test/resources/</span><span
						class="bold">test.properties </span></span> <br> Create it using <span
					class="code">test.template.properties</span> (in the same folder).

					class="code">appengine-web.template.xml</span>. For dev server
					testing, property values can remain as they are.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Open Eclipse and import → general → 'existing projects into
			workspace' (see the <span class="bold">Troubleshooting</span> section
			below if encounter any problem). After the importing is complete,
			following settings should be applied automatically (they are here for
			reference only).
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Properties→Google→Web application
					<ol type="i">
						<li>'this project has a WAR directory' is selected.</li>
						<li>'Launch and deploy from this directory' points to <span

							should appear in the list . That way, DataNucleus Enhancer runs
							only when you modify your entity classes.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>In Eclipse, go to Windows → Preferences → Java → Installed
			JRE and ensure a JDK (not a JRE) is selected. One of the items in the
			<a href="#settingup-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> section
			below explains how to do this.
		</li>
		<li>Right-click on the project folder and choose 'Run' → 'As Web
			Application'. After some time, you should see this message on the
			console “Dev App Server is now running” or something similar.<br>
			The dev server is now ready to serve requests at the given URL. You
			can verify by visiting the URL in your Browser. <br>To
			login to the system, you need to add yourself as an instructor first
			 (described below).
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Adding instructor accounts</h3>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Go to <span class="code">http://[appURL]/admin/adminHomePage
				(On your computer, it may be http://localhost:8888/admin/adminHomePage)</span></li>
		<li>Log in using your Google ID. If this is the dev server, enter
			any email address, but remember to check the 'log in as
			administrator' check box.</li>
		<li>Enter credentials for an instructor. e.g., <br> Google
			id: teammates.instructor<br> Name: John Dorian <br>
			Email: teammates.instructor@gmail.com<br>
			Institute: National University of Singapore <br>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Running the test suite</h3>
	Before running the test suite, we need to change the time zone of the
	dev server to UTC, as expected by test cases. Here is the procedure.
	<ul>
		<li>Stop the dev server, if it is running already.</li>
		<li>Specify timezone as a VM argument:<br> 
			Go to the 'run configuration' you used to start the dev server.<br> 
			Click on the to the "Arguments" and add 
			<span class="code">-Duser.timezone=UTC</span>
			to the "VM arguments" text box.
		</li>
		<li>Save the configuration for future use:<br> Go to the
			"Common" tab (the last one) and make sure you have selected <br>
			"Save as --> Local file" and <br>
			"Display in favorites menu --> Run, Debug".
		</li>
		<li>Start the server.</li>
	</ul>

	This can be done using the "All tests" option under the
	green "Run" button in the Eclipse toolbar. If this option is not available
	(sometimes, Eclipse does not show this option immediately after you set
	up the project. It will appear in subsequent runs. 
	'Refreshing' will make it appear too.), run
	<span class="bold code">src/test/testng.xml</span> (right click and
	choose 'Run as → TestNG Suite'). Most of the tests should pass. <br> 
	If a few cases fail (this can happen due to timing issues), run the failed
	cases using the "Run Failed Test" icon in the TestNG tab in Eclipse until
	they pass. The default browser used for testing is the Firefox browser.
	Testing on the Firefox browser is relatively faster as compared to the
	other browsers, and it can be run in the background. 
	<br>
	<br> To change the browser that is used in the UI tests, go to the
	<span class="code">test.properties</span> file and change the
	<span class="code">test.selenium.browser</span> value to the browser
	you want to test. Possible values are
	<span class="code"> firefox, chrome, or iexplore.</span> In
	addition, you need to configure the browser you have selected so that
	it works with the test suite.
	<br>
	<br>
	<span class="bold">Firefox</span>
	<ul>
		<li>If you are planning to test changes to JavaScript code,
			disable javascript caching for Firefox - Enter "about:config" into
			the Firefox address bar and set: network.http.use-cache = false</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="bold">Chrome</span>
	<ul>
		<li>If you are planning to test changes to JavaScript code,
			disable javascript caching for Chrome - Press ctrl-shift-j to bring
			up the Web Console. At the bottom-right corner, there is a settings
			button. Click on that. Under the General tab, check 'Disable Cache'</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="bold">Internet Explorer</span>
	<ul>
		<li>If you are planning to test changes to JavaScript code,
			disable javascript caching for Internet Explorer - Go to Internet
			Options. On the General tab, under Browsing History click Settings.
			Select the "Every time I visit the webpage" radio button.</li>
		<li>Ensure that the browser zoom level is set to 100%</li>
		<li>Set the Protected Mode settings for each zone to be the same
			value. The value can be on or off, as long as it is the same for
			every zone. To set the Protected Mode settings, choose "Internet
			Options..." from the Tools menu, and click on the Security tab. For
			each zone, there will be a check box at the bottom of the tab labeled
			"Enable Protected Mode".</li>
	</ul>

	<span class="bold">Note:</span> When testing with Chrome and Internet
	Explorer, the chromedriver process and the IEDriverServer process will
	not automatically get killed after the tests have finished executing.
	You will need to manually kill these processes after the tests are
	done. On Windows, you can do this using the Task Manager or 'tskill' DOS
	command.

				project must be configured to use a jdk in order to use jsp"</span>. <br>
			SOLUTION: This happens because Eclipse is only aware of JRE, not JDK
			(Compiling JSP requires the JDK). Go to
			Window→Preferences→Java→Installed JREs. You will note that a JRE path
			is the one selected, not a JDK path. To fix this, Click add→Standard
			VM, then for the JRE Path enter the path of the <span class="code">jre</span>
			folder inside your jdk installation folder. e.g., <span class="code">C:\jdk1.7\jre</span>
			Now you should see all of the JARs added to the library section.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>ERROR: When trying to deoply, Eclipse complains <span
			class="code">"...Unable to update app: Cannot get the System
				Java Compiler. Please use a JDK, not a JRE."</span>. <br> SOLUTION:
			You can force Eclipse to use the JDK (instead of JRE) by modifiying
			the <span class="code">eclipse.ini</span> file. See <a
			href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13913019/changing-jdk-in-eclipse">here</a>
			for more details.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>ERROR (on Windows): Dev server launched by Eclipse keeps
			running even after closing Eclipse. After restarting Eclipse, you'll
			be able to relaunch dev server on the same port but requests will be
			received by the previous server instance.<br> SOLUTION: If
			Eclipse crashes while development server is running inside Eclipse,
			the server might keep running even after Eclipse is closed. Go to
			Windows Task Manager and kill processes named javaw.exe.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>ERROR (on Windows), <span class="code">NullPointerException</span>
			when trying to access email box. The error message looks something
			like this:<br> <span class="code">java.lang.NullPointerException
				at <br>
				javax.mail.internet.ParameterList.set(ParameterList.java:165) at <br>
				com.sun.mail.imap.protocol.BODYSTRUCTURE.parseParameters(BODYSTRUCTURE.java:390)<br>
		</span> SOLUTION: In eclipse, move the <span class="code">javax.mail.....jar</span>
			(from Oracle) to the top of the build class path. (Properties → Java
			build path → 'order and export' tab)
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>ERROR: Eclipse complains "file out of sync".<br>
			SOLUTION: 'refresh' the project in eclipse.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>ERROR: Tests fail randomly during dev server testing.<br>
			SOLUTION: Make sure there is only one dev server running. Eclipse
			will happily allow you to start multiple dev servers.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>ERROR: Eclipse complains "<span class="code">There are
				no JREs installed in the workplace that are strictly compatible with
				this environment.</span>"<br> SOLUTION: Eclipse may be using an
			incompatible version of the JRE Library (with respect to TEAMMATES)
			for the current JRE definition. System Library for JRE should be set
			to the workspace default, after appropriate JRE definition has been
			added (covered in existing point#2 of the troubleshooting section).<br>
			-> Right-click on project<br> -> Properties<br> -> Java
			Build Path<br> -> "Libraries" tab<br> -> Select JRE System
			Library from the list<br> -> Edit...<br> -> Select and mark
			radio button for "Workspace default JRE"
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>ERROR: Test failure message encountered when running full
			test suite: “Selenium cannot find Firefox binary in PATH”.<br>
			SOLUTION: Path to Firefox executable on local machine is incorrect.
			Specify the correct folder in system PATH variable.<br> -> Open
			Windows Explorer<br> -> Right-click on Computer<br> ->
			Advanced System Settings<br> -> “Advanced” tab<br> ->
			Environment Variables…<br> -> Select “PATH” from the list<br>
			-> Add directory of “Mozilla Firedox” folder to “Variable value”
			field
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>ERROR: A handful of failed test cases (<10)<br>
			SOLUTION: Ensure compatible version of Firefox is installed as
			specified under <a href="#settingup-prerequisites">Prerequisites</a>.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>ERROR: Browser alert about invalid ssl certificate.<br/>
			SOLUTION: Ensure that test.app.url in your test.properties
			 uses -dot- instead of '.' when using secondary subdomains.<br/>
			Eg. http\://4-30<span class="bold">-dot-</span>teammates-john.appspot.com <br/>

	<h2 id="process-fixingissues">Fixing Issues</h2>
	Role: Dev
	<br>
	<br> {If you need any help regarding the workflow, please post in
	the
	<a
		href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/teammates-contributors">teammates-contributors
		Google group</a>.}
	<ol>
		<li>Select an issue to handle. Get it assigned to you.
			Contributors can request for an issue to be assigned to you by
			posting a comment under the issue in concern.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Optionally, you can discuss alternative solutions before
			choosing one to implement. This can be done through Issue tracker or
			email group. Such a discussion reduces the chance of the fix being
			rejected later.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Mark the issue as <span class="code">Started</span>.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>Update your local repo (the one you created when setting up
			the project on your computer) with the latest version of the code
			from the committer repo. <br> <span class="code"> hg pull
				https://code.google.com/p/teammatespes/ <br> hg update
		</span>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>Start a new branch named <span class="code">Issue{IssueNumber}</span>.
			If you are already working in a branch, remember to switch to trunk
			(i.e. <span class="code">default</span> branch) before creating the
			new branch. e.g., <br> <span class="code"> 
				#switch to
				trunk (if required)<br> 
				hg update default<br> 
				#create new	branch<br> 
				hg branch Issue{issue number} <br> 
				#e.g. hg branch	Issue236
		</span>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>Fix the issue.
			<ul>
				<li>Have a look at our coding and testing best practices (links
					given <a href="http://teammatespes.googlecode.com">here</a>) before
					you start your first issue.
				</li>
				<li>Keep in mind that we have 'reference' code that has extra
					explanatory notes to help new developers. These are listed in the
					'Coding Best Practices' document.</li>
				<li>You may commit as many times as you wish while you are
					fixing the code. These commits are for your own use and will not be
					visible to others. Once you are done with fixing the issue, we
					package the commits as a single patch before uploading to Rietveld
					(our code review system).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>When the work is ready for review:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Sync with the committer repo: While you were fixing the
					issue, others might have pushed new code to the committer repo. In
					that case, update your repo with any new changes from committer
					repo and merge those updates to your branch<br> <span
					class="code"> hg pull https://code.google.com/p/teammatespes/<br> 
						hg merge default<br> 
						hg commit -m "your commit message"
				</span>
				</li>
				<li>Format the code: Select the code segments you modified and apply
					the code formatting function of Eclipse (Source --> Format). This
					is to ensure that the code is properly formatted. You may tweak the
					code further to improve readability as auto-format doesn't always
					result in a good layout.<br></li>
				<li>Ensure dev green (i.e., all tests are passing on dev
					server).</li>
				<li>If your new code might behave differently on a remote
					server than how it behaves on the dev server, ensure staging green
					(i.e., all tests are passing against the modified app running on
					your own GAE staging server).</li>
				<li>Upload the changes as a patch to code review system. <br>
					<span class="code">upload.py --rev=default -t Issue "{issue
						number} : {branch description as given in Issue tracker}"<br>
						#e.g., upload.py --rev=default -t "Issue 829 : Remove unused
						constants from Attributes classes"
				</span><br> 
				Linux/Unix users need to change the permission of upload.py. <br>
				<span class="code">chmod +x upload.py<br>
				./upload.py --rev=default -t Issue "{issue
						number} : {branch description as given in Issue tracker}"
						
				</span><br>
				See <a
					href="https://code.google.com/p/rietveld/wiki/UploadPyUsage">here</a>
					for more about <span class="code">upload.py</span> usage.<br>
				</li>
				<li>Change Issue status to <span class="code">ReadyForReview</span>.
					In the 'comments' text box, specify the direct URL (here is <a
					href=https://codereview.appspot.com/9045043/">an example URL</a>)
					to the issure created on the <a
					href="https://codereview.appspot.com">code review system</a>. This
					way, the reviewer can reach your new code in one click. 
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>Repeat above two steps until the Issue is marked as <span
			class="code">ReadyToMerge</span> by the reviewer. If the Issue is
			marked as <span class="code">ChangesRequired</span>, you need to do
			further changes based on comments reviewer added in the code review 
			system. When uploading another patch to an existing issue, you need 
			to add the following option to the upload command in order to add the
			new patch to the existing issue in the code review system.
			<br><span class="code">-i {issue number from the code review system 
			(not from our issue tracker)} <br>
			#example
			<br>upload.py --rev=default -t "Issue 829 : Remoe unused constants from Attributes classes" 
			<span class="bold">-i 9045043 </span>

	<h2 id="process-reviewingafix">Reviewing a fix</h2>
	Role: reviewer
	<br>
	<br> This is a static code review. No need to apply fix or run
	tests.
	<br> Add comments in the contributor repo or in the committer repo
	(as appropriate).
	<br>
	<br> Try to make sure
	<br> a) The solution is optimal.
	<br> b) The code is of acceptable quality.
	<br> c) Tests have enough coverage.
	<br> d) Appropriate documentation have been updated (if
	applicable). DevMan, Spec, Analysis doc, Help pages, and the Features
	page are some pages that might need updating.
	<br>
	<br> Try to finish the review within a day of submission.
	<br> Once the review is done, publish your comments. If the code
	is ready for release, change the status to
	<span class="code">ReadyToMerge</span> and ask the team lead to merge
	the branch.
	<br>If the code is not ready for release, change the status to
	<span class="code">ChangesRequested</span>.

	<h2 id="process-applyingafix">Applying a fix</h2>
	Role: team lead
	<ol>
		<li>Pull the latest code from the committer repo</li>
		<li> Download the patch from Rietveld@GoogleCode to the project root folder.</li>
		<li>Apply the patch.<br> 
		<span class="code">hg import patch_file_name --no-commit</span><br>
		<span class="code gray">#e.g. hg import 1245.diff --no-commit</span><br><br>
		</li>
		<li>Verify 'dev green'. If the change does not involve automated
			tests, do a manual test. e.g., changes to documentation.<br><br></li>
		<li>if the changed code could potentially behave differently on a
			remote server, verify 'staging green' (i.e. use your own app on
			appengine as the 'staging site')<br><br></li>
		<li>If not green: <br>
			<ul>
				<li>Inform Developer of any broken code by changing the Issue status.</li>
				<li>Remove the patch from your local repo.
					<br> <span class="code">hg -revert --all</span>
				</li>
			</ul> <br> If green:
			<ul>
				<li>Commit the patch. <br>
				Use the -u option to specify the issue owner name. 
				<span class="code gray">e.g. -u "Jim Davis"</span><br>
				The commit message should be<br> 
				<span class="code">Issue {issue number} : {branch description as given in Issue tracker} <br>
				Update Issue {issue number}	</span><br>
				Example : <br>
				<span class="code">Issue 829 : Remove unused constants from *Attributes classes <br>
				Update Issue 829	</span><br>
				Here's how to use multi-line commit message from command line: <br>
				<span class="code">hg commit -u "User name" -m "</span>{press enter}<br>
					This will pause the commit operation and pop up a text file in your
					text editer with some comments inside. Insert the commit message at
					the beginning of that text file, save, and close the file. The
					commit operation will complete at that point.
				</li>
				<li>Push the default branch to the committer repo. <br> 
				<span class="code">hg push {committer repo URL} -b default </span>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>Set issue status to <span class="code">Delivered</span>.

			<br> x: major version, yy: feature release, zz: builds for
			feature yy or updates that doesn't affect functionality<br>
